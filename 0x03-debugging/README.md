## 0-main.c, main.h 
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative\(\) function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project: 

## 1-main.c 
Copy this main file. Comment out \(don’t delete it\!\) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop 
- Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code 
- You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.

## 2-largest_number.c, main.h 
This program prints the largest of three integers 
-? 
That’s definitely not right 
- Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

## 3-main_b.c 
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
